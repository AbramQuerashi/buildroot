This branch shows how to include a package outside of the buildroot tree.

Usage:

    mv hello ../
    make qemu_x86_64_defconfig
    echo 'BR2_PACKAGE_HELLO=y' >> .config
    make BR2_JLEVEL=2
    qemu-system-x86_64 -M pc -kernel output/images/bzImage -drive file=output/images/rootfs.ext2,if=virtio,format=raw -append root=/dev/vda -net nic,model=virtio -net user

From inside qemu:

    hello

Expected output:

    hello

In this example, `hello` must be placed at a fixed location, as we have hardcoded the relative path from the buildroot root to the `src/` directory in `hello/external.mk`:

    HELLO_SITE = ../hello/src

The source could of course be placed anywhere else, including outside `hello/`, you just have to modify `exteral.mk`.

This setup is intended to simulate a possible use case where you have a buildroot submodule and a hello package on the main git repository:

    .git/
    buildroot   # Submodule.
    hello       # Package.

If you want to remove an out of tree package from the build, you will need:

    rm output/.br-external
