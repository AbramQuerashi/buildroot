This branch shows how to include a package outside of the buildroot tree.

Usage:

    ./run

From inside qemu:

    hello

Expected output:

    hello

This setup is intended to simulate a possible use case where you have a buildroot submodule and a hello package on the main git repository:

    .git/
    buildroot   # Submodule.
    hello       # Package.

If you want to remove an out of tree package from the build, you will need:

    rm output/.br-external
